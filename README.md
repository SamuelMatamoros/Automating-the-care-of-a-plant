# Automating the care of a plant

### Automatización del cuidado de una planta

<br>


## Introducction
"Automating the care of a plant" is a project born form a school assignment. The objective of the project is to build a fully functional prototipe that can autonomously address the plant's needs and fulfil them. 

To do so we will use a microcontroller,the ESP32, alongside some sensors and other devices. Creating some sort of *smart pot*.
