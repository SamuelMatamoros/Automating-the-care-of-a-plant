# Automating the care of a plant

### Automatización del cuidado de una planta

<br>


## Introducction
"Automating the care of a plant" is a project born form a school assignment. The objective of the project is to build a fully functional prototipe that can autonomously address the plant's needs and fulfil them. 

To do so we will use a microcontroller,the ESP32, alongside some sensors and other devices, creating some sort of *smart pot*. The intended look for it is the following:

## Work in progress

Still this isn't a finished proyect. In fact, I plan to continue developing and improving it.
